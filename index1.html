                    <span>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </span> was an
                    Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
                    2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                    efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                    ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
